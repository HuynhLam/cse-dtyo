## cse-dtyo

This \LaTeX -template has been used by various people at department 
since the late 1990's, and has slowly improved over time.  It is still 
somewhat rough at the edges, but hopefully will be helpful in reducing 
some of the pain involved in writing a diploma thesis.

Contributors to the template include Mika Korhonen (original author), 
Pekka Pietikäinen, Christian Wieser, Teemu Tokola and Juha Kylmänen.  If 
you make any improvements to this template, ask us at ouspg @ ee.oulu.fi 
for a merge.

The template was updated during the summer of 2013 by Juha Kylmänen.
