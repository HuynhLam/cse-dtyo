This \LaTeX -template has been used by various people at department 
since the late 1990's, and has slowly improved over time.  It is still 
somewhat rough at the edges, but hopefully will be helpful in reducing 
some of the pain involved in writing a diploma thesis.

Contributors to the template include Mika Korhonen (original author), 
Pekka Pietikäinen, Christian Wieser and Teemu Tokola.  If you make any 
improvements to this template, please contact ouspg@ee.oulu.fi, and we 
will try to include them in further revisions.

The template was updated during the summer of 2013 by Juha Kylmänen.
